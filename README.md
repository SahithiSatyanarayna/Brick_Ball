Ball brick is a game where there will be a ball at the ground level and with that ball you have to destroy all the bricks above it. For each hit the bricks will come closer to ground level. When the ball touches the ground then you lose GAME OVER..!! If you destroy all the bricks before the bricks touches the ground then you win HURRAY..!!+
